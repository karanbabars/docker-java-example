This is a Dockerfile, which is a set of instructions used to create a Docker image for running a Java program. Here's a simple explanation of each line:

FROM amazoncorretto:latest
This tells Docker to use the latest version of the Amazon Corretto image as the base image. Amazon Corretto is a version of Java provided by Amazon.

WORKDIR /app
This sets the working directory inside the container to /app. Any subsequent commands will be run in this directory.

COPY Docker.java /app
This copies the Docker.java file from your local machine into the /app directory inside the container.

RUN javac Docker.java
This compiles the Docker.java file into a .class file using the javac (Java compiler) command. This prepares the Java program to run.

CMD ["java", "Docker"]
This specifies the command to run when the container starts. It runs the Java program by executing java Docker, where Docker is the name of the compiled Java class.

In short, this Dockerfile creates a container that runs a Java program (Docker.java) using Amazon Corretto. It copies the program into the container, compiles it, and then executes it when the container starts.
