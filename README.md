This is a Dockerfile, which is a set of instructions used to create a Docker image for running a Java program. Here's a simple explanation of each line:

FROM amazoncorretto:latest
This tells Docker to use the latest version of the Amazon Corretto image as the base image. Amazon Corretto is a version of Java provided by Amazon.

WORKDIR /app
This sets the working directory inside the container to /app. Any subsequent commands will be run in this directory.

COPY Docker.java /app
This copies the Docker.java file from your local machine into the /app directory inside the container.

RUN javac Docker.java
This compiles the Docker.java file into a .class file using the javac (Java compiler) command. This prepares the Java program to run.

CMD ["java", "Docker"]
This specifies the command to run when the container starts. It runs the Java program by executing java Docker, where Docker is the name of the compiled Java class.

In short, this Dockerfile creates a container that runs a Java program (Docker.java) using Amazon Corretto. It copies the program into the container, compiles it, and then executes it when the container starts.

commands :
-->docker build -t example/first:v2 .

docker build: This command tells Docker to build a new image based on the instructions in the Dockerfile.
-t example/first:v2: The -t option is used to tag the image with a name and version. In this case, the image will be named example/first and tagged as v2. The tag v2 is a version identifier, so you can have multiple versions of the same image.
.: The dot at the end specifies the build context, meaning Docker will look for the Dockerfile in the current directory (where the command is run).

So, this command builds a Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory and tags it as example/first:v2.

-->docker run --name first_container example/first:v2

docker run: This command tells Docker to run a container from a specific image.
--name first_container: This option gives the running container a name. In this case, the container will be named first_container.
example/first:v2: This is the name and version of the image that will be used to create the container. Itâ€™s the image you just built in the previous command.
So, this command runs a container using the example/first:v2 image and names the container first_container.

In summary:

The first command builds a Docker image from the Dockerfile and tags it as v2.
The second command runs a container from that image and gives it the name first_container.
